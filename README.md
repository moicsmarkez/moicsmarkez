## About me 👽
I prefer version control systems (repositories) git with ci/cd before making backup folders of a copy. I work with agile methodologies such as scrum (Jira | notion software), I like to exemplify remote work and make snippets that do repetitive tasks. I would like to further advance my code with backend technologies, mainly PHP | Java | GoLang | python, and always ready to support more javascript | NodeJS. 

I was born almost mounted on a pc, and although I started as a fan of games, now I fell in love with code, I consider that before learning a programming language, well, first learn English, then javascript :D!
